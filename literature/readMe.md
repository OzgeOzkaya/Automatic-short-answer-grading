| [GradeAid: a framework for automatic short answers grading in educational contexts—design, implementation and evaluation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-023-01892-9) | proposes GradeAid, a framework for ASAG. It is based on the joint analysis of lexical and semantic features of the students’ answers through state-of-the-art regressors; differently from any other previous work, (i) it copes with non-English datasets, (ii) it has undergone a robust validation and benchmarking phase, and (iii) it has been tested on every dataset publicly available and on a new dataset (now available for researchers).         |  1) Lexical (TFIDF) + Semantic(BERT Cross Encoder) features, 2) Training for Classification(2=> means correct, else not correct) and Regression 3) (focusing on regression) Trained with Adaptive Boosting, RF, SVR, ElasticNet, Ridge Regression Models  4) Evaluation, they used 10k fold for large datasets, LOO-CV for small datasets 5) Evaluation metrics, RMSE, MAE, NRMSE        | See the paper.       |  See the paper.           |             |   [Github](https://github.com/edgresearch/code-automaticgrading-2022)          |
