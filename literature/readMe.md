| [GradeAid: a framework for automatic short answers grading in educational contexts—design, implementation and evaluation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-023-01892-9) | proposes GradeAid, a framework for ASAG. It is based on the joint analysis of lexical and semantic features of the students’ answers through state-of-the-art regressors; differently from any other previous work, (i) it copes with non-English datasets, (ii) it has undergone a robust validation and benchmarking phase, and (iii) it has been tested on every dataset publicly available and on a new dataset (now available for researchers).         |             |         |             |             |   [Github](https://github.com/edgresearch/code-automaticgrading-2022)          |
